# 3D Website with Three.js and A-Frame

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create an engaging 3D web experience using both Three.js and A-Frame. It features interactive 3D elements rendered with A-Frame and a rotating 3D cube created with Three.js, all on a single webpage.

## Features

- **A-Frame Scene**:
  - Interactive 3D box, sphere, and plane.
  - Basic lighting and camera setup.
  - Event-based interactions to change the color of the box on mouse hover.

- **Three.js Scene**:
  - Rotating 3D cube.
  - Basic scene setup with `WebGLRenderer` and `PerspectiveCamera`.
  - Continuous rotation due to the animation loop.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics using WebGL.
- **A-Frame**: A web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences with HTML-like syntax.
